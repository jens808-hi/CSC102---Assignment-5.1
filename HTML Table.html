                                In 1989 Timothy Berners-Lee among other researchers at CERN created hypertext, which enables users to navigate to separate and related documents by using key words 
                                to link those documents together. For this concept to work a "markup language" that allowed links to be added to text had to be created.  HTML files are plain text files.
                                The extension .html  and the entire document is encased within html open and close tags.
                                </p>

                                There are libraries of functions that many languages provide for. Functions are like modules, with the exception
                                that it returns a value that your program can use.
                            <td>Debugging is a method of identifying the problem (aka bugs), isolating it at the source, correcting the errors in the code, and then testing it. 
                                Debugging helps troubleshoot the root cause of coding errors, prevents software malfunctions and improves performance. Debugging is done when 
                                a developer finds coding errors in a program and is able to reproduce it. When attempting to identify bugs, an integrated development environment 
                                (IDE) is a very useful tool, highlighting lines of code corresponding to error messages simutaneously in real-time effectively pinpointing the root 
                                of the problem. 
                            <td>Software Development refers to to a process where a series of tasks are dedicated to creating, designing, deploying, testing,
                                maintaining, and supporting software applications. The function of these processes is to create programmable software to cater to
                                the business or personal objectives and goals through writing computer code.

                                -Agile Development: Focues on flexibility, continuously evolving functionality by an incremental approach. <br> <br>
                                -Rapid Application Development (RAD): Focuses prototyping on speed and flexibility over strict planning. <br> <br>
                                -Rational Unified Process (RUP): Framework that is tailored by organizations to best suit the specific needs of different projects. <br>

                            <td>Arrays were created in programming to store and manage multiple values of the same data type under a single variable name, enabling programmers
                                to easily access and manipulate it as a unit, leading to a more concise code that's eaiser to manage. Arrays can be accessed efficiently by their index number. 
                                Examples of creating an array literal in Javascript:

                                it never became the standard for many reasons. There were other iterations of a stylesheet language by others but it wasn't until
                                Hakon Wium Lie created Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) that it became the standard. CSS is a programming language where we state

                                Strings can be stored as a constant or a variable that is fixed to an element or allows it be changed. String manipulation refers to
                                the process of modifying, extracting, or transforming strings. One example is concatenation; meaning to join two or more strings together. 
                                Slicing strings to get only a portion of a string is an example of extracting strings. By changing specific parts of a string you can replace
                                characters of a string. Converting a string to upper and lower case is an example of transforming strings. You can split a string by breaking it 
                                into an array of substrings. Using the trim feature you can remove leading or trailing whitespaces. Here are some string manipulation methods:

                            A loop is iterated until the data is false or bad to determine the validation of user input. Empty input or wrong input are types of errors.
                            Common errors are: <br>

                            Data Integrity may be compromised if Input Validation is not ensured; resulting in data corruption, processing the wrong information,

                            <td>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a model for writing programs and programming languages based on abstraction of objects,
                            through this process a programmer conceals the data and code except for what is relevant to an object in order to reduce complexity,
                            making it easier to work with. This can contain data in fields known as attributes or properties and code in procedures known as methods.
                            For instance a button class has variables for data and functions, which can be inherited by a subclass and created as a subset of the 
                            button class. Objects are instances of classes. Using a concept known as structure or struct we can store multiple variables in one name: <br>
