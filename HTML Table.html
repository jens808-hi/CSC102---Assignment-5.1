                        <td>In 1989 Timothy Berners-Lee among other researchers at CERN created hypertext,
                            which enables users to navigate to separate and related documents by using key words 
                            to link those documents together. For this concept to work a "markup language" that 
                             allowed links to be added to text had to be created.  HTML files are plain text files.
                            The extension .html  and the entire document is encased within html open and close tags.
                        <td>By definition "a function is a module that returns a value back to the part of the program that called it."
                            There are libraries of functions that many languages provide for. Functions are like modules, with the exception
                            that it returns a value that your program can use.
                        <td>Debugging is a method of identifying the problem (aka bugs), isolating it at the source, correcting the errors in the code, and then testing it. 
                            Debugging helps troubleshoot the root cause of coding errors, prevents software malfunctions and improves performance. Debugging is done when 
                            a developer finds coding errors in a program and is able to reproduce it. When attempting to identify bugs, an integrated development environment 
                            (IDE) is a very useful tool, highlighting lines of code corresponding to error messages simutaneously in real-time effectively pinpointing the root 
                            of the problem. 
                        <td>Software Development refers to to a process where a series of tasks are dedicated to creating, designing, deploying, testing,
                            maintaining, and supporting software applications. The function of these processes is to create programmable software to cater to
                            the business or personal objectives and goals through writing computer code.
                            <h4>There are 6 stages to the Software Development Cycle (SDLC): <br>
                            1. Planning <br>

                            6. Maintenance</h4>
                            <h4>Popular Software Development Processes are: <br>
                            -Waterfall Development: Steps are executed linearly and sequentially in a waterfall approach. <br>
                            -Agile Development: Focues on flexibility, continuously evolving functionality by an incremental approach. <br>
                            -Rapid Application Development (RAD): Focuses prototyping on speed and flexibility over strict planning. <br>
                            -Rational Unified Process (RUP): Framework that is tailored by organizations to best suit the specific needs of different projects.

                        <td>Arrays were created in programming to store and manage multiple values of the same data type under a single variable name, enabling programmers
                            to easily access and manipulate it as a unit, leading to a more concise code that's eaiser to manage. Arrays can be accessed efficiently by their index number. 
                            Examples of creating an array literal in Javascript:
                            <h4>var starWarsLightSabers = ["green", "white", "blue","purple", "yellow"]; <br>

                            Creating an empty array then adding to the array with a push: <br>
                            <h4>var starWarsLightSabers = [ ]; 
                            starWarsLightSabers.add("Pssshhew")</h4><br>

                        <td>Strings hold data that represent a sequence of characters, words or symbols as a single unit that are enlcosed in quotation marks.
                            Strings can be stored as a constant or a variable that is fixed to an element or allows it be changed. String manipulation refers to
                            the process of modifying, extracting, or transforming strings. One example is concatenation; meaning to join two or more strings together. 
                            Slicing strings to get only a portion of a string is an example of extracting strings. By changing specific parts of a string you can replace
                            characters of a string. Converting a string to upper and lower case is an example of transforming strings. You can split a string by breaking it 
                            into an array of substrings. Using the trim feature you can remove leading or trailing whitespaces. Here are some string manipulation methods:
                        <h4>-String.charAt() <br>
                            -String.lenght <br>
